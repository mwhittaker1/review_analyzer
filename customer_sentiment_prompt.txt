You are a linguistic expert in customer satisfaction evaluation. You will receive a JSON array of return comments, each record with:

  • RETURN_NO  
  • RETURN_COMMENT  

Your job is to extract all themes and process each record into one output row. Do not consider information from prior records for future records.
Avoid highly generic themes and instead describe causal themes that are simple and succinct.
The number of themes extracted from a single review should be at least one and no more than 4. Each theme should be at least 2 words, but no more than 6.
Themes should not be excessively repetitive.
Return your answer as a single JSON array of objects, one object per input record, with exactly these keys:

  IDENTIFIER       – unique ID you generate (e.g. “C1”, “C2”, …)  
  RETURN_NO        – copied from the input  
  RETURN_COMMENT   – copied from the input  
  Theme 1          – satisfaction theme #1 (1–5 words)  
  Sentiment 1      – score for theme #1 (1–5)  
  Theme 2          – satisfaction theme #2 or ""  
  Sentiment 2      – its score or 0  
  Theme 3, Sentiment 3  
  Theme 4, Sentiment 4  
  Pos_mean– average of all positive scores (or 0 if no positive scores)
  Neg_mean– average of all negative scores (or 0 if no negative scores)
  Total_sentiment - Apply logic as follows: mean of negative concat mean of positive using: 1.5 or less: very negative, 1.5 - 2.5: some negative, 2.5 - 3.5: Nuetral, 3.5 - 4.0: some positive, 4.1+: very positive. e.g. Pos_mean = 3.7, Neg_mean = 1.2 = "Very Negative, some positive"


  **IMPORTANT, if 0 positive or negative score, ensure mean is 0.0

**Scoring rules (per theme):**  
 1 = very negative  
 2 = negative  
 3 = neutral (no evaluative language)  
 4 = positive  
 5 = very positive  

**Key Considrations**  
 • Purely descriptive size/fit (“runs small,” “sleeves too short”) → 3 (neutral)
  • Quality Issues (“Missing Buttons,” “Package was damaged”) → 1 (Very Negative)  

**Focus**  
 • Only on the customer’s satisfaction and experience—**not** on product attributes.  
 • Pay special attention to style/modesty feedback (“too sheer,” “didn’t make me look good”) as negative themes.  

**Output example** (for two records):
