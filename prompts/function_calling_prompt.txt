# Comment Analysis Instructions

I need you to analyze customer comments about products or services. For each comment, please:

1. Identify up to 3 main themes in the comment. A theme is a specific topic, issue, or aspect mentioned.

2. For each identified theme, determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

3. Provide an overall sentiment for the entire comment.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Always return your analysis using the function format provided
- Include exactly the requested data fields
- Keep theme descriptions concise but informative 
- For sentiment values, use only: "positive", "negative", or "neutral"
- For each comment, produce a complete analysis with all required fields

Example structure (DO NOT copy this format, use the function format):
* Theme 1: Product quality
* Sentiment 1: Positive
* Theme 2: Shipping time
* Sentiment 2: Negative
* Theme 3: Customer service
