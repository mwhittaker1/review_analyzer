Analyze each customer comment thoroughly to extract the following information:

1. Identify up to 3 main themes in each comment. A theme is a specific topic, issue, or aspect of the product/service being discussed.

2. For each theme, determine the sentiment expressed (positive, negative, or neutral).

3. Provide an overall sentiment rating for the entire comment.

Be precise and consistent in your analysis. Focus on extracting factual information from the text rather than making assumptions.

For each comment, return:
- The main themes identified (up to 3)
- The sentiment for each theme (positive, negative, or neutral)
- The overall sentiment of the comment

Do not include any explanations or reasoning in your response, only the structured data requested.
